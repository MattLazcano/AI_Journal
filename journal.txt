Week of september 8th
- This week for our Week 1 excercises, which are in Python, I used ChatGPT to help me with Python concepts since I have never formally learned Python in the past. 
  So for each question, I would attempt to do it in python and then double check my work with GPT if I encountered an error. We then went over the concept I was having trouble with, like how to use it,
  where it can be helpful, and practice problems. In the past I have learned C++ and Java, so for certain questions that I knew how to do in java or C++, I would ask GPT how I can do the same in python
  or if I even can. GPT became a mentor and a code translater for me, in order to help me learn python.

Week of September 15th
- I didnt use AI any differently this week. Same thing as last week.

Week of Sep 22nd
- This week, I used AI to summarize some academic papers I needed to read for a class. I was short on time and needed to read 4 papers that my professor assigned before class started later that
evening. With the help of AI, I knew what the papers were about and was able to participate in class. I've used AI for this a lot, especially for academic papers, since they are very long and wordy.
Another way I used AI was to brainstorm project ideas for another class. My group and I were stuck on trying to figure out what to do for our semester project, but after asking AI for some ideas that
related to our topic, we quickly were able to decide on an idea.
