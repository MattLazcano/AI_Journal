Week of september 8th
- This week for our Week 1 excercises, which are in Python, I used ChatGPT to help me with Python concepts since I have never formally learned Python in the past. 
  So for each question, I would attempt to do it in python and then double check my work with GPT if I encountered an error. We then went over the concept I was having trouble with, like how to use it,
  where it can be helpful, and practice problems. In the past I have learned C++ and Java, so for certain questions that I knew how to do in java or C++, I would ask GPT how I can do the same in python
  or if I even can. GPT became a mentor and a code translater for me, in order to help me learn python.

Week of September 15th
